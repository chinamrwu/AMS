Determination of differential methylation regions (DMR) on cancer genome

First, all the CpG islands  are selected from  each of  the chromosomes except X and Y,
for each island, the sliding window algorithm is used to compute the averaged methylation level of normal samples and cancer samplse respectively,
and the ROC of potential DMR.
On the first sliding step, the window covers the first and the second probes and the ROC of the two probes
is computed ,then the window slides to the next step, where the second  and the third probes are covered,and
the second ROC is computed. With the window sliding to the end of the island, the window slides to the last step with window widht 2.
After reaching the end of island, we increase the width of the window to cover 3 continuous probes and the steps repeat as the previous
